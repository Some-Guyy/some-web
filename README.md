# Some Website

Just a small website I built while learning how to use [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

Currently under construction

When installing packages, there will be a warning:
```
npm WARN Could not resolve dependency:
npm WARN peer react@"^16.8.0" from use-dark-mode@2.3.1
```
There isn't any actual conflicts, just [force](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode/issues/69#issuecomment-805969670) it with the `--force` parameter.
