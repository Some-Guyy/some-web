# Some Website

Just a small website I built while learning how to use [React](https://reactjs.org/).

There isn't much to see now.

## Known Issues
When installing packages, there may be a warning similar to this:
```
npm WARN Could not resolve dependency:
npm WARN peer react@"^16.8.0" from use-dark-mode@2.3.1
```
There aren't any actual conflicts, just [force](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode/issues/69#issuecomment-805969670) it with the `--force` parameter.
